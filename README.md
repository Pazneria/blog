# Blog

This repository contains the blog section of the website. It will host blog posts using GitHub Pages.

## How to add a new post

1. Create a new Markdown file inside a directory for posts (e.g., `posts/`). If the directory does not exist, create it.
2. Name the file using the date and a short slug, such as `2025-01-01-my-first-post.md`.
3. Write your post in Markdown. At the top of the file you can include any front matter or metadata required by the static site generator that will be used later.
4. Commit the file to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and publish the new post.

This is a placeholder blog; the design and generator will be added later.
